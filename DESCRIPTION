Description: A package that handles the gory details of block-cyclic
    distribution. It distributes input data into files readable by a ScaLAPACK
    SVD program, initializes scripts and calls to ScaLAPACK SVD (which are easy
    to modify based on the cluster and queuing system you are running on), and
    reconstructs the output data from ScaLAPACK SVD for general use.
